           <p>I would like to one day visit Johannesburg. I have always wondered how life would be in another province. The city of gold is South Africa's biggest city.It is also one the most exiting cities with fun things to do like bungee jumping off the soweto cooling towers, most celebritites  reside in jozi.And also because one of my  favourite music genres,kwaito music, a catchy genre of African house music that was born in the 90s and has become a South African phenomenon. It is most famous for its catchy lyrics that embody post-apartheid township culture. I want to experience a different cultural lifestyle .
